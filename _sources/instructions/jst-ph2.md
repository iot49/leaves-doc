# Crimping JST ph 2.0 connectors

* Tool: Pad-11 crimper
* Steps:
    * Get single connector (no tabs)
    * Hold crimper in left hand, size markings to the right
    * Insert connector in 1.6 opening, strain relief tabs flush with crimper and facing down
    * Remove insulation so that the wire part just covers the wiring tabs (but does not enter the connector or stick out into the strain releave part; approx 2mm)
    * Insert wire into connector and crimp
    * Remove connector, verify that wire holds tightly
    * Slightly "pre-crimp" strain releave tabs with pliers so they are about parallel
    * Reinsert connector into 1.6 opening of crimper, strain relief tabs in crimping section and facing down (wire to the left)
      * Note: use 1.6 opening, otherwise the connector won't fit into the ph 2.0 housing
    * Crimp
    * Insert connector into ph 2.0 housing so that the top small "hole" lienes up with the small hole of the housing. The connector should "snap" in easily

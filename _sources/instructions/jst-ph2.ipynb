    "    * Get single connector (no tabs)\n",
    "    * Hold crimper in left hand, size markings to the right\n",
    "    * Insert connector in 1.6 opening, strain relief tabs flush with crimper and facing down\n",
    "    * Remove insulation so that the wire part just covers the wiring tabs (but does not enter the connector or stick out into the strain releave part; approx 2mm)\n",
    "    * Insert wire into connector and crimp\n",
    "    * Remove connector, verify that wire holds tightly\n",
    "    * Slightly \"pre-crimp\" strain releave tabs with pliers so they are about parallel\n",
    "    * Reinsert connector into 1.6 opening of crimper, strain relief tabs in crimping section and facing down (wire to the left)\n",
    "      * Note: use 1.6 opening, otherwise the connector won't fit into the ph 2.0 housing\n",
    "    * Crimp\n",
    "    * Insert connector into ph 2.0 housing so that the top small \"hole\" lienes up with the small hole of the housing. The connector should \"snap\" in easily\n",
